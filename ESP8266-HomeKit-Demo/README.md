# ESP8266-HomeKit-Demo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit-Demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit-Demo)
User part of the [ESP8266-HomeKit](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit) foundation

## UPDATE 17 Dec 2017

Please read the message in [issue 41](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit/issues/41) about the switchover to Maxim Kulkin code base.

-------

Public Apple's HomeKit protocol code has been around for some time for more potent processors
(notably [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS)).  
This is a rewrite for the ESP8266 for you to play with. Note that this does not get you a certified HomeKit accessory!

For the latest build instructions please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit-Demo/wiki) or go into the Demo directory.

# Demo

# About the code

The Demo code provides an example of how to create a basic accessory with a dimmable light and an on/off led (GPIO2).
It uses the [ESP8266-HomeKit](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit) API to create your HomeKit device without descending to the lower levels of the HAP protocol.

## Timings

Here are some preliminary timings. 

### Pairing

Pairing is dominated by the SRP algorithm which is very slow and expensive. Fortunately this only happens once when the iOS device is being associated with the HomeKit device:

- Time1: 25 seconds from boot till start of server, so that initial interaction is split second.

- Time2: 30 seconds (based on a build with DEBUG logging which is slow).

### Verify

Verify happens every time an iOS device reconnected to the HomeKit device. Ideally this should be as fast as possible.

- Time: 1.2 seconds

## Memory

The HomeKit code is approximately 400K and about 18K of RAM is left for other purposes. During Pairing so much RAM is used that it is required to launch most code after pairing is done.

# Practical HardWare

There is a repository for practical [HardWare](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/HardWare) to deploy your code.

# Thanks

I want to thank a number of projects which made this possible:

1. [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) - which documents the HomeKit protocols for IP and allowed me to guess how they
were implemented.

2. https://github.com/aanon4/HomeKit - which inspired this README and should inspire us to look into assembly.

3. [ESP8266_RTOS_SDK](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK) - Espressif for their great product
